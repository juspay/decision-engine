### üöÄ Feature: `gateway_id` for Gateways

This feature enables explicit differentiation between multiple instances of the same gateway (e.g., Stripe) in a profile, allowing proper routing and reporting.

---

#### üßæ **Before (`gateway_id` not available)**

```text
               |----- Stripe ------|
profile ---                             ---> No way of differentiation  
               |----- Stripe ------|
```

- Multiple Stripe connectors used within a profile.
- No way to distinguish between them in routing or logs.
- Results in ambiguity during rule evaluation or payment tracking.

---

#### ‚úÖ **Now (with `gateway_id`)**

```text
               |----- Stripe ------> gateway_1 ---> payment_1
profile ---                                                           ---> Proper differentiation  
               |----- Stripe ------> gateway_2 ---> payment_2
```

- Each Stripe connector is tied to a unique `gateway_id` (`gateway_1`, `gateway_2`).
- Payments routed distinctly via `payment_1`, `payment_2`.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Enum Variant Array Condition

Allows routing based on multiple card networks (e.g., Visa, Mastercard):

```json

            "gateway_name": "Bambora",
            "gateway_id": "mca_111"
          }

                "gateway_id": "mca_114"
              }
            ]

          "statements": [
            {
              "condition": [
                {
                  "lhs": "card_bin",
                  "comparison": "equal",

## üåü Condition-Free Routing Features

Below are three rule types that **require no conditions**; they route payments (or payouts) {This is new as well, basically transaction segregator (you can have two rules active at once, one for payments, one for payouts and we can support more transaction kinds as well, so basically nof transation_types == nof of active rules at once )} directly based on their configuration.
