# Decision Engine 
## Overview 

The Decision Engine system helps in choosing the most optimal payment gateway in real-time for every transaction based on pre-defined rules, success rate, latency and other business requirements. It is a fully modular service that can work with any orchestrator and any PCI-compliant vaults.

## Vision 

Build a reliable, open source payments software for the world \- which is interoperable, collaborative and community-driven.

## Features

The Decision Engine comes with the following features out-of-the box for your payment routing needs. 
‚úÖ Eligibility Check ‚Äì Ensures only eligible gateways are used, reducing payment failures and improving transaction success.

üìå Rule-Based Ordering ‚Äì Routes transactions based on predefined merchant rules, ensuring predictable and obligation-driven payment processing.

üîÑ Dynamic Gateway Ordering ‚Äì Uses real-time success rates and ML-driven optimization to route transactions to the best-performing gateway.

‚ö†Ô∏è Downtime Detection ‚Äì Monitors gateway health, dynamically reordering or pausing routing to prevent transaction failures during downtime.
