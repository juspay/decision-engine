# Decision Engine - Project Brief

## Project Overview

The Decision Engine is a sophisticated payment routing system designed to optimize payment gateway selection in real-time for each transaction. It makes intelligent decisions based on pre-defined rules, historical success rates, latency metrics, and specific business requirements.

## Vision

Build a reliable, open-source payments software for the world that is interoperable, collaborative, and community-driven.

## Core Capabilities

The Decision Engine offers several key capabilities:

- ‚úÖ **Eligibility Check**: Ensures only eligible gateways are used, reducing payment failures and improving transaction success.
- üìå **Rule-Based Ordering**: Routes transactions based on predefined merchant rules, ensuring predictable and obligation-driven payment processing.
- üîÑ **Dynamic Gateway Ordering**: Uses real-time success rates and ML-driven optimization to route transactions to the best-performing gateway.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Downtime Detection**: Monitors gateway health, dynamically reordering or pausing routing to prevent transaction failures during downtime.

## System Architecture

The Decision Engine is built as a fully modular service using a Rust-based backend with the following components:

- **API Layer**: Provides RESTful endpoints for gateway decisions and feedback
- **Routing Engines**: 
  - Priority Logic-based routing using predefined rules
  - Success Rate-based routing using historical performance data
  - Euclid routing engine for complex business rules
- **Database Storage**: Persistent storage for configurations and historical performance data
- **Redis Cache**: In-memory caching for high-performance data access
- **Feedback Loop**: Mechanism to update gateway performance metrics based on transaction outcomes

## Key Objectives

1. **Optimize Payment Success Rates**: Intelligently route transactions to increase overall payment success rates.
2. **Provide Flexibility**: Allow merchants to define custom routing rules based on their business needs.
3. **Support Multiple Payment Methods**: Handle diverse payment methods including cards, UPI, wallets, and more.
4. **Enable Data-Driven Decisions**: Use historical transaction data to continuously improve routing decisions.
5. **Ensure High Performance**: Deliver sub-millisecond routing decisions for real-time payment processing.

## Target Users

- **Payment Processors**: Organizations that process large volumes of payments and need optimization
- **E-commerce Platforms**: Businesses that want to maximize payment success rates
- **FinTech Companies**: Companies building payment solutions that require intelligent routing
- **Financial Institutions**: Banks and other institutions integrating with multiple payment gateways

## Licensing

This product is licensed under the AGPL V3 License, emphasizing its open-source and community-driven nature.
