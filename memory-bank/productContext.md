# Decision Engine - Product Context

## Business Problem

### Payment Gateway Routing Challenges

Payment processing systems often integrate with multiple payment gateways to process transactions. However, selecting the optimal gateway for each transaction presents several challenges:

1. **Varying Success Rates**: Different gateways have varying success rates based on payment method, card issuer, transaction amount, and other factors.

2. **Gateway Downtime**: Payment gateways occasionally experience downtime or degraded performance, requiring dynamic rerouting.

3. **Cost Optimization**: Different gateways charge varying fees, creating an opportunity for cost optimization through intelligent routing.

4. **Business Rules Compliance**: Merchants often have specific rules or obligations that dictate gateway selection (e.g., contractual volume commitments).

5. **Regional Performance Variations**: Gateway performance can vary by geography, currency, and payment method.

6. **Latency Considerations**: Transaction speed is critical for user experience, making gateway response time an important factor.

## Solution Overview

The Decision Engine solves these challenges by providing:

1. **Intelligent Gateway Selection**: Automatically selecting the best-performing gateway for each transaction based on historical success rates.

2. **Dynamic Failover**: Detecting gateway outages in real-time and rerouting transactions accordingly.

3. **Rule-Based Routing**: Allowing merchants to define custom rules that influence gateway selection based on business needs.

4. **Continuous Optimization**: Using a feedback loop to constantly update success metrics and improve future routing decisions.

5. **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Considering multiple factors (payment method, amount, currency, etc.) when making routing decisions.

## User Experience Goals

### For Merchants

1. **Improved Transaction Success Rates**: Higher overall payment success rates leading to increased revenue.

2. **Reduced Gateway Costs**: Optimization based on gateway performance and cost structures.

3. **Business Rule Compliance**: Ensuring routing decisions align with business obligations and preferences.

4. **Operational Resilience**: Minimizing impact of gateway outages through automatic failover.

5. **Analytical Insights**: Understanding gateway performance patterns to inform business decisions.

### For End Customers

While end customers don't directly interact with the Decision Engine, they benefit from:

1. **Higher Payment Success Rate**: Fewer payment failures and declined transactions.

2. **Faster Checkout Experience**: Reduced payment processing time through optimal gateway selection.

3. **Greater Payment Method Support**: Access to more payment options due to multi-gateway integration.
