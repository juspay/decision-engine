# Cab Service Framework Implementation Status

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### Core Framework
- Abstract interfaces for all components (filters, comparators, output processors)
- Working memory for fact storage and retrieval
- Basic decider factory with algorithm selection

### Cab Service Components
1. **Filters**:
   - ✅ `DriverAvailabilityFilter`: Filters drivers within a certain distance
   - ✅ `VehicleTypeFilter`: Matches requested vehicle types
   - ✅ `DriverRatingThresholdFilter`: Ensures minimum driver quality standards
   - ✅ `SpecialRequirementsFilter`: Matches special needs (wheelchair, etc.)

2. **Comparators**:
   - ✅ `DriverDistanceComparator`: Ranks drivers by proximity
   - ✅ `DriverRatingComparator`: Ranks drivers by rating
   - ✅ `ETAComparator`: Ranks drivers by estimated arrival time

3. **Processors**:
   - ✅ `CombinedRankingProcessor`: Weighs distance vs. rating
   - ✅ `DriverChoiceProcessor`: Lets riders choose from multiple drivers

4. **Algorithms**:
   - ✅ `DriverMatchingAlgorithm`: Basic driver matching algorithm
   - ✅ `PremiumRideAlgorithm`: Specialized algorithm for premium/luxury rides

5. **UI**:
   - ✅ Configuration interface
   - ✅ Testing console with templates
   - ✅ Decision flow visualization
